# Maelstrom challenge

Rust solutions for the distributed systems challenges by [Fly.io](https://fly.io/dist-sys/). Challenges are build on top of system called `Maelstrom`.

# Running things locally
1. Install `Maelstrom`, see the [instructions](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/01-getting-ready/index.md#prerequisites).
2. Modify the `MAELSTROM` variable path in the Makefile to make it point to the installed binary.
3. Run the different parts using the make targets.
